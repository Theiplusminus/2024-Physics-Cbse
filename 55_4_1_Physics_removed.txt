Note : Questions number 29 to 30 are Case Study based questions. Read the following paragraph and answer the questions that follow.
29. A pure semiconductor like Ge or Si, when doped with a small amount of suitable impurity, becomes an extrinsic semiconductor. In thermal equilibrium, the electron and hole concentration in it are related to the concentration of intrinsic charge carriers. A p-type or n-type semiconductor can be converted into a p-n junction by doping it with suitable impurity. Two processes, diffusion and drift take place during formation of a p-n junction. A semiconductor diode is basically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage. A p-n junction diode allows currents to pass only in one direction when it is forward biased. Due to this property, a diode is widely used to rectify alternating voltages, in half-wave or full wave
configuration.	4 x 1 = 4

(ii) At a given temperature, the number of intrinsic charge carriers in a semiconductor is 2.0 x 1010 cm-3. It is doped with pentavalent impurity atoms. As a result, the number of holes in it becomes 8 x 103 cm-3. The number of electrons in the semiconductor is
(A) 2 x 1024 m-3	(B)  4 x 1023 m-3
(C)  1 x 1022 m-3	(D)  5 x 1022 m-3

(A) electrons diffuse from p-region into n-region and holes diffuse from n-region into p-region.

(A) 25 Hz, 50 Hz	(B)  25 Hz, 100 Hz
(C)  50 Hz, 50 Hz	(D)  50 Hz, 100 Hz

30. A lens is a transparent optical medium bounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula of image formation by a single spherical surface successively at the two surfaces of a thin lens, a formula known as lens maker's formula and hence the basic lens formula can be obtained. The focal length (or power) of a lens depends on the radii of its surfaces and the refractive index of its material with respect to the surrounding medium. The refractive index of a material depends on the wavelength of light used. Combination of lenses helps us to  obtain  diverging  or  converging  lenses  of  desired  power  and
magnification.	4 x 1 = 4
