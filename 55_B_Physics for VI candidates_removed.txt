This bending of light is called refraction of light. The extent to which a ray deviates in medium 2 from its initial path in medium 1, is determined by the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1.

30. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges
+ q and q separated by a distance 2a. A dipole can be characterised by dipole moment determined by its charge and separation between the two charges. It is a vector quantity.
