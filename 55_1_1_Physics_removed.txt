30. Junction Diode as a Rectifier :
The process of conversion of an ac voltage into a dc voltage is called rectification and the device which performs this conversion is called a rectifier. The characteristics of a p-n junction diode reveal that when a p-n junction diode is forward biased, it offers a low resistance and when it is reverse biased, it offers a high resistance. Hence, a p-n junction diode conducts only when it is forward biased. This property of a p-n junction diode makes it suitable for its use as a rectifier.
Thus, when an ac voltage is applied across a p-n junction, it conducts only during those alternate half cycles for which it is forward biased. A rectifier which rectifies only half cycle of an ac voltage is called a half-wave rectifier and one that rectifies both the half cycles is known as a full-wave rectifier.

(C) Less than half cycle of the input signal
(D) Only for the positive half cycle of the input signal
(iii) In a full-wave rectifier :	1
(A) Both diodes are forward biased at the same time.
(B) Both diodes are reverse biased at the same time.
(C) One is forward biased and the other is reverse biased at the same time.
(D) Both are forward biased in the first half of the cycle and reverse biased in the second half of the cycle.

will be :	1
